            And the <em><u>lesson</u></em> is always the same, and young poets recognize this 
            to be one of the most important lessons they can learn: if you have any 
            idea for a poem, an exact grid of intent, you are on the wrong path, a
             dead-end alley, at the top of a cliff you haven’t even climbed. This is a 
            <em><u>lesson</u></em> that can only be learned by trial and error.

            And then I found a poem of mine that I had carefully 
            written by hand in the sixth grade, and at the bottom of the page, 
            in India ink, <em><u>beautifully</u></em> apart from the rest of the text, were the words The End.

            You might say a poem is a <em><u>semicolon</u></em>, a living <em><u>semicolon</u></em>,
             what connects the first line to the last, the act of 
             keeping together that whose nature is to fly apart.

            And I realized children very often denote 
            the end because it is indeed a great achievement for them to 
            have written anything, and they are completely unaware of 
            the number of stories and poems that have already been
             written; they know some, of course, but have not yet found
              out the extent to which they are not the only persons residing 
              on the planet. And so they sign their poems and stories like <em><u>kings</u></em>. 
              Which is a wonderful thing.

            Between the first and last lines there exists—a poem—and

            I believe many fine poems begin with ideas,

            That, too, yes and always, because self-consciousness 
            is its own pretension, and has been from its beginning;

            Everyone knows that if you query poets about how their poems
             <em><u>begin</u></em>, the answer is always the same: a phrase, a line, a 
             scrap of language, a rhythm, an image, something seen, heard,
              witnessed, or imagined.

            As the poet Ralph angel puts it, “The poem is an interpretation
             of weird theatrical shit.” the weird theatrical shit is what goes 
             on around us every day of our lives; an animal of only instinct, 
             Johnny Ferret, has in his actions drama, but no <em><u>theater</u></em>; <em><u>theater</u></em>
            requires that you draw a circle around the action and observe it 
            from outside the circle; in other words, self-consciousness is <em><u>theatre</u></em>.

            I have never, in my life, read a poem that ended with the words
             The <em><u>End</u></em>. Why is that, I wonder. I think perhaps the brevity of 
             poems compared to novels makes one feel that there has been no 
             great sustention of energy, no marathon worthy of pulling tape 
             across the finish line.
