    <pre class="one">
                        I think it is easier to
                talk about the end of a poem
 than it is to talk about its beginning. Because the poem
         ends on the page, but it begins off the page, 
                it begins in the mind.   
    </pre>

    <pre class="two">
                         But there is no
            book I know of on the subject of
                         how poems begin. 
    </pre>

    <pre class="three">
                                    The mind acts,
                                the mind wills a poem,
              often against our own will; somehow this happens,
                    somehow a poem gets written in the middle of a
                 chaotic holiday party that  has just run out of ice, 
                                          and it's your house. 
        
    </pre>

    <pre class="four">
                               How can
                     the origin be traced
             when there is no form or shape
                that precedes it to trace?  
    </pre>

    <pre class="five">
                                   It is exactly like tracing
                             the moment of the big bang—
             we can go back to a nanosecond before the beginning
                         before the universe burst into being,
                  but we can’t go back to the precise beginning
                because that would precede knowledge,
                    and we can’t “know” anything before “knowing”
                                          itself was born.    
    </pre>

    <pre class="six">

                        In poetry, the 
                    number of  beginnings 
          so far exceeds the number of endings that 
                  we cannot even conceive of it.
    </pre>

    <pre class="seven">
                     That nothing 
                can precede action—
        no breath before act, no thought before act, 
                   no pervasive love before
                     some kind of act.
    </pre>

    <pre class="eight">
             I believe the 
         poem is an act of 
                the mind.
    </pre>
   
    <pre class="nine">
                                Not every poem is finished—
                            one poem is abandoned, 
         another catches fire and is carried away by the wind, 
              which may be an ending, but it is the ending of 
                         a poem without an end. 
    </pre>
    
    <pre class="ten">
                     In the beginning was the Word.
             Western civilization rests upon those words. 
     And yet there is a lively group of thinkers who believe that
                     in the beginning was the Act.
