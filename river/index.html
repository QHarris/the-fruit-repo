            Now here is something really interesting (to me), something&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;you can use at a standing-up-only party when&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; everyone is tired of hearing there are one million   &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;         three-thousand-two-hundred-ninety-five  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;   words used by the Esimo for snow. This is what Ezra Pound learned from Ernest Fenollosa: Some languages are so     &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;       constructed—English among them—that we   &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  each  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;       only really speak one      &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;    sentence in our    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;   lifetime.    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;       That sentence begins with your    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;       first words, toddling    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;    around the kitchen,   &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;       and ends   &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  with your last        &emsp;&emsp;      words right   &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; before you step into  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;   the &emsp;&emsp; limousine,  &emsp;or in a nursing   &emsp;home, the  &emsp;&emsp;  night-duty attendant vaguely   &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;    on hand. Or, &emsp;&emsp;   if you are  &emsp; blessed, they are heard by  someone  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;       who knows       &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;        you and   loves         &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;     you and   &emsp;&emsp; will be &emsp;&emsp;   sorry to hear the sentence        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;      end. 
<br>
When I      told Mr. Angel&emsp;about the&emsp;lifelong sentence,&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; he said: “That’s a&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;lot of      semicolons!” he is     absolutely right;     the sentence    would      be unwieldy  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  and awkward and resemble    &emsp;&emsp;     the novel of a savant, but    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;          the next time &emsp;   you use  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  a  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;    semicolon (which, by the way, is the &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;        least-used  &emsp;&emsp;  mark of punctuation in all      &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;     of poetry) you should   &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; stop and be thankful that there exists this  &emsp;&emsp;   little thing, invented by a human being—an Italian as a matter of   &emsp;fact—that allows us to go on and keep on           &emsp;&emsp;     connecting speech that for  &emsp;   all apparent        &emsp;&emsp;     purposes is unrelated. &emsp;
<br>
I have flipped through books, reading &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;vhundreds of opening and closing lines, across ages, across cultures, across aesthetic schools, and I have discovered that&emsp; first lines are &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;remarkably similar, even &emsp;repeated, and that last lines are &emsp;&emsp;remarkably similar, even repeated.&emsp;&emsp; Of course in all&emsp; cases they remain &emsp;&emsp;remarkably distinct, because&emsp; the words belong to &emsp;completely different&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; poems. And i began &emsp;&emsp;to realize,&emsp; reading these &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;first and last lines, that &emsp;&emsp;there are not&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; only the &emsp;first and last&emsp; lines of&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; the lifelong sentence &emsp;we each speak but also &emsp;the first and last &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;lines of the long piece of&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; language delivered to use by others, by those we &emsp;listen to. And in the best&emsp;&emsp; of all possible lives, that&emsp; beginning and that end are the same: in &emsp;&emsp;poem after poem I encountered words that mark &emsp;&emsp;the first something made &emsp;out of language that we hear as children &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;repeated night after night, like&emsp; a refrain: I love you. &emsp;I am here with you.&emsp; Don’t be afraid. Go to sleep now.&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; And I encountered words that&emsp; mark the last something made out&emsp;&emsp; of language that we hope &emsp;to hear on earth: I love you. I am here with you. Don’t be afraid. &emsp;&emsp;Go to sleep now. 
<br>
But it&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; is growing &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;damp and I must go in. Memory’s fog is rising. Among Emily &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Dickinson’s last words&emsp;&emsp; (in a letter). A woman whom&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; everyone thought of as shut-in, &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;homebound, cloistered,&emsp; spoke&emsp; as if she &emsp;&emsp;had been out, exploring the earth, her&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; whole life, and &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;it was &emsp;&emsp;finally &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;time to go in. And it was.
